# Word Guessing Game Coding Exercise

This is a word-guess game in which a user plays against the computer.
The computer will generate a random word, kept secret from the player(user).
The player(user) will have 6 attempts.
If the player(user)'s guess is correct, the computer will reveal all occurrences of that letter.
A player wins when all letters in the word are revealed with less than 6 failed attempts.
If the player runs out of attempts, the GAME  IS OVER and the computer has won.
